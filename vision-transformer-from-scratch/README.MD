# Vision Transformer (ViT) — Minimal NumPy Implementation

This repository contains a small-from-scratch implementation of a Vision Transformer (ViT) in NumPy.

## Run the example

From the repository root:

Make sure `numpy` is installed (see `requirements.txt`), then run:

```bash
python examples/run_inference.py
```

This runs a one-layer demo and prints output logits.
